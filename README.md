# choose-your-adevnture-story-editor

A python program that lets users create a choose-your-own-adventure type of story in the terminal. It is designed to work with MacOS and Linux. 
The editory.py file can be used to create a story with the commands shown at the bottom of the terminal when the file is run. Similarly, reader.py can be used to read a story created using the editor.py program. 
A sample story file, mystory.story is added so that users can test the reader (or feel free to edit the file in the editor).
